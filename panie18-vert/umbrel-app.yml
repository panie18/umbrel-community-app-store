  Installing VERT via this Umbrel app will start the VERT web service on port 3000 (host) -> 80 (container).

  Using Docker
  ------------
  This Umbrel app supports two modes:
  1. Build from the VERT repository (so you can set build-time variables) — recommended if you need to change PUB_* build args.
  2. Use the prebuilt image from the GitHub Container Registry (faster, but build-time variables are baked into the image).

  Manually building the image (via docker-compose build)
  - The compose included with this Umbrel app sends build args into the image so you can configure:
    PUB_ENV, PUB_HOSTNAME, PUB_PLAUSIBLE_URL, PUB_VERTD_URL, PUB_DONATION_URL, PUB_DISABLE_ALL_EXTERNAL_REQUESTS, PUB_STRIPE_KEY

  Using an image from the GitHub Container Registry
  - If you prefer the published image (ghcr.io/vert-sh/vert:latest) note that build-time variables are baked into the image and cannot be changed at runtime.

  Troubleshooting
  - If you need a custom build arg that is not exposed in the Umbrel UI, rebuild the image locally with your desired build args and update the service image tag.
